      <h2>Anime</h2>
      
        
        <p> <h3> what is Anime?:</h3>
        What is anime you ask?? If not the next best creation of humans after toast? Its basically a mixture of god-tier graphic animation and the greatest story telling.
       <h3> What got me into anime?:</h3>
      Hmmm? This is a tough one, I started out watching anime in middle school i'd say and no, I wasn't one of those kids that would do the naruto run down the hallways. I was actually like you at first, until I watched Attack on titan, it is so gooddd(sobs in italian)</p>

    <!-- Cooking -->
    <section>
      <h2>Cooking</h2>
      <p> <h3> why do I like cooking:</h3>
        Say you have $50 left in your wallet, you could go and buy dinner at Olive Garden or you could go to the market, buy groceries and cook enough food that could last you the entire week. well maybe not the whole week but you get the point
       <h3> What got me into cooking?:</h3>
        It started as a chore to be honest, I always had to cook for my sisters and mom and it just kinda grew on me after that. I like trying new ingredients and new recipes.

    <!-- Racquetball -->
    <section>
      <h2>Racquetball</h2>
      <p> <h3> why Racquetball?:</h3>
        This is an interesting one, I started playing racquetball not too long ago, I just wanted something to pass the time with but now I enjoy it. It always goes like that with interests for me. I start and then I grow attached to it.
