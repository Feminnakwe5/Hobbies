        <p> <h3> what is Anime?:</h3>
        What is anime you ask?? If not the next best creation of humans after toast? Its basically a mixture of god-tier graphic <a href=https://animeukiyo.com/anime-with-the-best-animation/> animation</a> and the greatest story telling.
       <h3> What got me into anime?:</h3>
      Hmmm? This is a tough one, I started out watching anime in middle school i'd say and no, I wasn't one of those kids that would do the naruto run down the hallways. I was actually like you at first, until I watched Attack on titan, it is so gooddd(sobs in italian). you should give it a <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GR751KNZY/attack-on-titan"> try </a></p>

      <p> <h3> why do I like cooking:</h3>
        Say you have $50 left in your wallet, you could go and buy dinner at <a href='https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nasty'>  Olive Garden </a> or you could go to the market, buy groceries and cook enough food that could last you the entire week. well maybe not the whole week but you get the point
       <h3> What got me into cooking?:</h3>
        It started as a chore to be honest, I always had to <a href='https://food52.com/recipes/61557-classic-nigerian-jollof-rice'>cook</a> for my sisters and mom and it just kinda grew on me after that. I like trying new ingredients and new recipes.

      <p> <h3> why <a href='https://www.sportrx.com/blog/history-of-racquetball/'>Racquetball?:</a></h3>
        This is an interesting one, I started playing racquetball not too long ago, I just wanted something to pass the time with but now I enjoy it. It always goes like that with interests for me. I start and then I grow attached to <a href='https://makeameme.org/meme/are-you-lying'>it</a>
